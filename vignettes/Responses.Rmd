### DataSettings

```

```

**Stimulus**: Values of the recording time units at which an event was triggered during the experimental recording. These time points are anchor points for a peak search and further calculations. Each stimulus must be named. If the names are the same, they are grouped together, otherwise they are considered as individual groups.

**PeakSearchWindow**: A search window can be specified in which the highest value is searched for. This then serves as the peak value. If one wants to examine the values at the same time points for each individual, then the values of **Start** and **End** are set to zero or for 3 time units after the stimulus to:

```
  PeakSearchWindow:
    BeforeStim: -3
    AfterStim: 3
```

### Description

```{r description, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cat(NosaAnalysis:::get_analyser_objects(list(SEM=list()), list())$SEM$description)
```

### YAML configuration

For a general description of the yaml configuration see:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("BasicGuide", package = "NosaAnalysis")
```

### Sheets

```
  Sheets:
    metadata: []
    Processed: []
```

### DataSettings

```
  Stimulus:
    Time:
    - 200
    - 450
    - 700
    - 1000
    Name:
    - A
    - B
    - A
    - B
  PeakSearchWindow:
    BeforeStim: 0
    AfterStim: 100
  CalculationWindow:
    Start: 50
    End: 50
```

**Stimulus**: Values of the recording time units at which an event was triggered during the experimental recording. These time points are anchor points for a peak search and further calculations. Each stimulus must be named. If the names are the same, they are grouped together, otherwise they are considered as individual groups.

**PeakSearchWindow**: A search window can be specified in which the highest value is searched for. This then serves as the time of peak for the calculation window.

**CalculationWindow**: Defines the subsets of the data on which to perform the analyses. For each peak found, a time period is set for the calculation. For example, if "Start" is -2 and "End" is +2, then the calculation window is symmetrical around the peak and 4 time units in size.

### Output

```
Output:
  SEM:
    Sheet: Processed
    Trace: yes
    PeakAverage: yes
    Threshold: no
```

**Trace**: Controls the creation of a plot containing the entire trace data, faceted by the GroupingKeyWords.

**PeakAverage**: Controls the creation of multiple plots, averaging the peaks. Facets by name and time of the stimuli.

**Threshold**: Draws a horizontal threshold line in each trace plot.
